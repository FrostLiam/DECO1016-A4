        <p> We are committed to the advancement of culture, to create positive social change and connect emerging communities. 107 Projects' philosophy and purpose is to improve communities by encouraging people to live creatively. </p>

        <p> We partner with property owners, public and private entities, such as Council and Developers. These key partners, like The City of Sydney, lease the building to us at a subsidised rent, and then it is through the generosity of donations that we make creative playgrounds that capture the ever-evolving nature of artistic expression and our roots as a space for experimentation and discovery. </p>

        <p> At Redfern every year we hold over 650 events, seeing over 35,000 visitors through the door and supporting more than 3,5000 artists.

        <p> A gift of $500 can provide our local neighbourhood with space to connect and experience creative endeavour, benefiting 9 artists and 95 members of community. </p>

        <p> All of this is made possible through philanthropy, individual and corporate donations. We self-generate 72% of income, 28% corporate sponsorship, donations, government grants and in-kind rent. For every $1 invested, we generate $3 of value for artists and the community! </p>

        <!-- text from https://107.org.au/volunteer-program/ -->
        <p> Volunteering is for ANYONE who would like to get involved. EVERYONE is invited to participate in 107's many welcoming, respectful, safe, fun, creative and experimental activities. </p>

        <p> With creativity, DIY spirit, accessibility and inclusivity at its core, the program is based on principles that have kept 107 a thriving hive of creative activity for almost two decades. </p>

        <p> With its felxible structure made up of both ready-made roles, opportunities to choose your own adventure and monthly info sessions, the new program is designed to support you where needed. No matter what skills you have and what responsibilities you are willing to take up, we will do our best to accommodate you. Design your own role, pitch a project! </p>

        <p> We believe volunteering should always be of mutual benefit. At 107, individual volunteers and the organisation as a whole work together on creative and community-oriented projects, and ultimately towards REAL positive social change. </p>

        <p> As we want every volunteer who joins our team to have a positive, fun and rewarding experience, weâ€™ve made sure that our program follows the ethical principles outlined by Volunteering Australia, the national body for volunteering in not-for-profit organisations. </p>

        <p> We look forward to receiving your application! </p>
