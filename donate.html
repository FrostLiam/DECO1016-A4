        <p> We are committed to the advancement of culture, to create positive social change and connect emerging communities. 107 Projects' philosophy and purpose is to improve communities by encouraging people to live creatively. </p>

        <p> A gift of $500 can provide our local neighbourhood with space to connect and experience creative endeavour, benefiting 9 artists and 95 members of community. </p>

        <p> All of this is made possible through philanthropy, individual and corporate donations. We self-generate 72% of income, 28% corporate sponsorship, donations, government grants and in-kind rent. For every $1 invested, we generate $3 of value for artists and the community! </p>
